# Even Realities Proximity Integration

## Overview
The **Even Realities Proximity Integration** package enables proximity detection within the Even Realities ecosystem, using Androidâ€™s built-in proximity sensor. It displays real-time proximity data on the **Even G1 HUD** and triggers an alarm if the detected object moves too far.

## Features
- **Real-Time Proximity Detection**: Measures distance in centimeters using the proximity sensor.
- **HUD Display Integration**: Sends proximity data to the Even Realities glasses.
- **Alarm Trigger**: Plays an alarm sound when the distance exceeds a predefined threshold.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Registers and unregisters the sensor listener as needed to conserve power.

## Requirements
- **Android Device** with a proximity sensor
- **Even G1 Smart Glasses** (for HUD integration)
- **Android Studio** (for compiling and testing the code)

## Installation
1. Clone or download the package:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
